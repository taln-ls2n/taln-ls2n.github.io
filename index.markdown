The TALN research group at <a href="https://www.ls2n.fr/">LS2N lab</a> is a team of faculty, postdocs and students who work together on algorithms that allow computers to process, generate, and understand human languages.

Our research interests are in the areas of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) with applications including health text mining, educational resources and scientific document analysis.
